# INTRODUCTION: 
A hotel management system is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate the operations 
of a hotel or hospitality establishment. It encompasses various modules to manage different aspects of hotel operations, including 
reservations, guest check-ins and check-outs, room assignments, housekeeping, billing, inventory management, and reporting.
This system aims to enhance efficiency, improve guest satisfaction, and optimize revenue generation for hotels by providing 
centralized control and real-time insights into various operational processes. Additionally, modern hotel management systems 
often integrate with other technologies such as online booking platforms, property management systems (PMS), point-of-sale (POS) systems, 
and customer relationship management (CRM) software to create a seamless guest experience and improve overall operational efficiency.
